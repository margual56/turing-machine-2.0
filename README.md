# Turing Machine 2.0
An improved Turing Machine made in Rust!

The [old one](https://github.com/margual56/TuringMachine) was not great in many ways, so I decided to completely re-write it from scratch!

## Demo:

## Installation
Go to [the releases page](https://github.com/margual56/turing-machine-2.0/releases/latest) and download the executable file for your operating system.

Otherwise, run `cargo install --git "https://github.com/margual56/turing-machine-2.0"`

## Usage
Just run the executable to get a GUI out-of-the-box. If you want to use the CLI, run it through the console with the argument `--cli`!
